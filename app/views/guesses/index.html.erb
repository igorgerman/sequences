<h1>A Quick Puzzle</h1>

<p>A short game sheds light on government policy, corporate America and why no one likes to be wrong.</p>

<p>Here’s how it works:</p>

<p>We’ve chosen a rule that some sequences of three numbers obey — and some do not. Your job is to guess what the rule is.</p>

<p>We’ll start by telling you that the sequence 2, 4, 8 obeys the rule:</p>

  <li>2, 4, 8 Obeys the rule</li>

<% @list.each do |guess|  %>
  <li>
    <%= guess.first_number %>,
    <%= guess.second_number %>,
    <%= guess.third_number %>

    <% if guess.first_number.to_i < guess.second_number.to_i && guess.second_number.to_i < guess.third_number.to_i %> Yes!
      <% else %> No.
      <% end %>
  </li>
<% end %>

<p>Now it’s your turn. Enter a number sequence in the boxes below, and we’ll tell you whether it satisfies the rule or not. You can test as many sequences as you want.</p>


<form>
  <label for = "first">First number:</label>
  <input name = "n1" id = "first" type = "text" placeholder = "The first number">

  <label for = "second">Second number:</label>
  <input name = "n2" id = "second" type = "text" placeholder = "The second number">

  <label for = "third">Third number:</label>
  <input name = "n3" id = "third" type = "text" placeholder = "The third number">
